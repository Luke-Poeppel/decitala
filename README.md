Random thoughts/tools/ideas:
* An August 13 update: I found a mixed representation that seems to capture the relevant information for both multiplicative and additive augmentations. This will allow for the creation of a single tree to query with a fragment. However, the downside to this representation is that it reduces the dimensionality of the vector. If, say, we have a 3 onset tala (corresponding to a 3 dimensional vector in Euclidean space), then the mixed representation will be, maximally, a 2 dimensional vector. The issue is, therefore, that we can't realistically search for two onset talas. But maybe this is a good thing! I thought it would be best to reserve these for the greek searching, anyway.

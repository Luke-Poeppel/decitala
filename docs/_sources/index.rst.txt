Decitala Documentation
====================================

Tools for automating ethnological rhythmic analysis of Olivier Messiaen's music. The basic
pipeline used in this package is Search →→ Path Finding →→ Analysis.

Installation
====================================
Run the following::

   $ cd # Navigate to home directory
   $ git clone https://github.com/Luke-Poeppel/decitala.git
   $ cd decitala
   $ pip3 install -e .
   $ pre-commit install
   $ decitala --version # Check for proper installation.

Rhythmic Manipulation
====================================
Messiaen often altered rhythmic fragments from the decitala database before including 
them in his composition. And yet he still establishes an equivalence relation such that
a fragment :math:`F` and a transformed fragment :math:`T(F)` are equivalent if there
exists a special kind (and highly specified) transformation between them. These possible 
transformations include multiplicative augmentation, additive augmentation, mixed augmentation, 
flips into retrograde, and subdivision. 

Basic Usage
====================================
Normally, this package is used to find "paths" of rhythms through a given composition, the rhythms
coming from a dataset. To calculate a path, you can simply use the following:

   >>> composition = "/Users/lukepoeppel/decitala/tests/static/Shuffled_Transcription_1.xml"
   >>> from decitala.search import path_finder
   >>> from decitala.hash_table import GreekFootHashTable
   >>> path = path_finder(
   ...   filename=composition,
   ...   part_num=0,
   ...   table=GreekFootHashTable(),
   ...   slur_constraint=True
   ... )
   >>> for fragment in path:
   ...   print(fragment["fragment"], fragment["onset_range"])
   ...
   <fragment.GreekFoot Peon_IV> (0.0, 0.625)
   <fragment.GreekFoot Iamb> (0.875, 1.25)
   <fragment.GreekFoot Peon_IV> (1.25, 1.875)
   <fragment.GreekFoot Peon_IV> (2.375, 3.0)

Desītālas
*********

Śārngadeva (शार्ङ्गदेव) compiled a list of 130 rhythmic fragments called desītālas (देसी ताल) in his 13th-century 
musicological treatise, the Sangītaratnākara (सङ्गीतरत्नाकर). “Desi” refers to the provinces of India in which the 
fragments were collected. They are encoded in the fragments_db.db file in the databases directory. They are also 
provided as XML files in the fragments directory.
